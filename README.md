# ESP8266 GAS Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to interface a gas sensor with an ESP8266 microcontroller to detect the presence of gas and display the status on the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **Gas Sensor (e.g., MQ-2)**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard (optional)**

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Gas Sensor to ESP8266:**
   - **VCC:** Connect to the 3.3V pin on the ESP8266.
   - **GND:** Connect to the GND pin on the ESP8266.
   - **DO (Digital Output):** Connect to the D5 pin (GPIO 14) on the ESP8266.

#### Instructions
1. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE with ESP8266 board support installed.
   - Install the necessary libraries if required.
   - Create a new sketch and paste the provided Arduino code.
   - Connect the ESP8266 to your computer, select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the ESP8266.

2. **Testing:**
   - After uploading the code, open the Serial Monitor.
   - You should see messages indicating whether gas is detected or not every 500 milliseconds.

#### Applications
- **Gas Leakage Detection:** Monitor for gas leaks in residential or industrial settings.
- **Air Quality Monitoring:** Track the presence of harmful gases in the environment.
- **Safety Systems:** Implement gas detection in safety systems to trigger alarms or notifications.

#### Notes
- **Sensor Calibration:** Calibrate the gas sensor according to the specific characteristics of your sensor to ensure accurate detection.
- **Power Supply:** Ensure a stable power supply to the ESP8266 and the gas sensor.
- **Sensitivity Adjustment:** Some gas sensors have a sensitivity adjustment potentiometer; adjust it according to your detection requirements.
